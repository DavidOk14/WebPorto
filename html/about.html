        Hello, and welcome to my webpage portfolio I've created for my Internet Programming course at UNT (CSCE 3420). My name is David Okoronkwo hence the name of the webpage and the image on the left is 
        a photo of me during the summer of 2023. Enough said for me, as for the website the creation of the page started October 20th, 2023 and as for this paragraph on the about page I started writing this
         at 6:39PM October 22nd as I have a deadline to beat for this assignment haha. I've have the current design powered using Bootstrap 5 and AWS. The purpose of the site is to give me a place to
        leave all of my Computer Science based work for future reference as well as giving others a chance to view the work and progress I have made during my time spent on my laptop. For any inquiries
        feel free to navigate to the "Contact" section of the webpage to ask me anything! <br><br><br>Please don't spam me college is stressful enough :)
    </p>
